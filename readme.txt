Google-Doc-Sharing Apps Script

by Jonathan Fichter, with special thanks to my brother and to the starter
code that Google provides

When connected to a Google spreadsheet under an account associated with
Google Apps for Education, Business, or Government, this program will use 
email addresses and documents you enter into the spreadsheet to create and 
share blank documents automatically.

To use this program, populate Column B of the spreadsheet with the titles of 
documents you wish to create, and populate Column A of the spreadsheet with 
the email address of the desired editor for each document.

To connect this script with the spreadsheet, click "Tools" from the spreadsheet
menu. Then select "Script Editor" and "Blank Project." (Please make sure it's
really blank. You may need to delete some starter code that Google creates 
for you.) Then, paste in all of the text you'll find in the file above entitled
GoogleDocSharingAppsScript. 

I'm not sure if this is necessary, but I usually select "Run" --> "onOpen" once 
before closing evertyhing. Then, the next time you open your spreadsheet, a new 
menu item will appear called "MrFichter's Doc-Sharing Script."

This menu item will enable you to run the script!

If you find this script useful, or if you modify it in an interesting way, 
please let me know! I'm @MrFichter on Twitter.
